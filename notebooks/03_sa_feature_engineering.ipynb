    "As noted previously, there are no missing values in the dataset. Also, there are very few outliers compared to the data size.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will first **split the data into training and test set**, and do feature engineering only on the training set, in order to avoid **data leakage**. Afterwards, I will apply these transformations to the test set. I will not use a validation set yet, since this serves as a helping step for initial model building. **Cross-validation** will be implemented during the model tuning and validation stage, and there I will have a separate test set for a final model validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For numerical variables, **scaling** is highly recommended because it helps some of the models, like linear regression and regularized regression, perform better. My choice is using **standardization**, but the other techniques like **min-max** scaling can be implemented. I will **one-hot encode** categorical variables, since it doesn't assume any kind of ordering between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use the metric called **Mutual Information** to detect relationship between the predictor variables and the target. Mutual information has an advantage over metrics like Pearson's  or Spearman's correlation because it can detect nonlinear relationships in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I will perform **feature transformation**, including transforming existing features or creating new ones by combining the predictors."

    "From the Mutual Information testing results, it is clear that the ratio `Stress Level per Sleep Hour = Stress Levels / Sleep Hours` has the largest effect on anxiety, with a score of $0.51$. It is followed by these predictors by themselves, with $0.37$ and $0.19$ for Stress Level and Sleep Hours respectively. From the MI score for Therapy Sessions, there is only slight difference for the log-transformed and untransformed column, the logarithm doesn't add much information. Other predictors have smaller contributions, with Alcohol Consumtion contributing the least to the anxiety levels."

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset doesn't contain missing values, so there was no imputation of values.\n",
    "* **Features** are **created** before splitting the data, while **scaling** is done after **train-test split** because scaling depends on the statistic.\n",
    "* The data is split into **training** and **test sets**, because the goal of the next stage is to roughly examine potential models. **Cross-validation** will be used in the model tuning stage.\n",
    "* For numerical features:\n",
    "    * Scaled features using **standardization**, which is useful for models such as linear and regularized regression.\n",
    "    * Performed logarithmic transformation of **Therapy Sessions**, due to its moderate skewness.\n",
    "    * Created a new feature **Stress Level per Sleep Hour = Stress Levels / Sleep Hours**, which represents stress levels per hour of sleep.\n",
    "* For categorical features: performed **one-hot encoding** for all features, since they all have low **cardinality** ($<15$)\n",
    "* Computed **mutual information (MI) scores** for numerical features:\n",
    "    * New variable **Stress Level per Sleep Hour** has the highest MI score $0.51$, meaning it's the best anxiety predictor.\n",
    "    * **Stress Level** and **Sleep Hours** individually are the next best predictors, with MI scores of  $0.37$ and $0.19$.\n",
    "    * **Therapy Sessions** and **Log Therapy Sessions** have a similar MI score, indicating that the log-transformation is likely unnecessary.\n",
    "    * **Caffeine Intake**, **Diet Quality** etc. are less important features, with **Alcohol Consumption** having the least impact on anxiety with a MI score of $0.0009$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps**:\n",
    "* Build several models, such as **linear regression**, **random forest**, **XGBoost** and train them on the training set.\n",
    "* **Evaluate models** on a test set, based on the chosen metric (like RMSE, MAE for regression).\n",
    "* Check linear regression assumptions: **linearity**, **homoscedasticity**, **normality of residuals**, and **multicollinearity**.\n",
    "* Perform **feature importance** for random forest and XGBoost, to see the contribution of each feature."
