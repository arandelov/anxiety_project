    "Keep in mind that these are preliminary findings, because filtering predictors based on their p-values on the entire dataset leads to information leakage, because you see the target values before the model is even trained. Hence, the results of these tests will be used only as guidance, not as an only way to filter and choose useful predictors before modeling. The proper way of determining whether or not a predictor is useful comes from model training, cross-validation and model tuning stages, where the target is used only within the training folds. \n",

First, I will turn my attention to the target variable. `'Anxiety Level (1-10)'` has a slight right skew, I will first find it's skew and kurtosis, and based on this result decide whether to use parametric or non-parametric statistical tests.\n"

    "`'Anxiety Level (1-10)'` has a skewness of $1.05$, which is moderate skew, but it doesn't represent a large issue for larger data size. Kurtosis is positive with the value $0.95$, meaning it has a higher peak and heavier tails compared to the normal distribution(which has kurtosis $0$). In theory, non-parametric tests like **Spearman's correlation**, **Kruskal - Wallis** and **Mann-Whitney U** should be used to test the data. However, since there are many rows in the data, $11000$ to be precise, I will be able to use parametric tests like **ANOVA**, **Pearson's correlation** and **t-test** because of the **central limit theorem (CLT)**.\n",

Note that the Tukey's test is not ideal here, because the ANOVA assumptions are violated and the results could be misleading. However, I will do it for purely demonstrative purposes, and compare it later to Dunn's test which is more adequate for an ordinal outcome such as Anxiety Level."

The difference `upper - lower` represents the $95 \\%$ confidence interval for the data. Here are all pairs of occupations which have statistically different mean values of anxiety levels. When I look at the computed means for each occupation, the top  5 are Lawyer, Doctor, Engineer, Scientist and Freelancer. However, I see that the Tukey's HSD test didn't give enough evidence that the means differ, meaning that for example there is no statistically significant difference between Artist and Freelancer, Artist and Scientist, and so on for other variables. \n",

    "In conclusion, the Tukey's HSD test showed that even though occupation influences anxiety levels, the effect is not consistent across pairs. Therefore, occupation might be a useful predictor when building models. Again, it was performed just for informative purposes, as the ANOVA's assumption are violated, and the results that I will focus on and report will be the ones from a Dunn's test."

    "The significance level is set to $\\alpha = 0.05$. The cells in which p-value $<0.05$ indicate a statistically significant result, meaning the difference in group medians is significant and I can reject the null hypothesis.  The Dunn showed that there is an effect for some occupations on anxiety level, but this effect is not consistent across pairs. From the table containing mean values and STD's, it can be seen that the largest difference in mean anxiety levels is $4.21 - 0.37 \\approx 0.46$. The medians are either $3$ or $4$ for all occupations. So, across all occupations the difference in average anxiety is less than $0.5$, so less than half a point for the anxiety levels taking values from $1$ to $10$. For the median values, the difference is $1$ point across all occupations. Because of this insight, I assume that the Occupation column is, at best, a moderate predictor for anxiety levels."

    "* Since both **Stress Levels** and **Sleep hours** have slight skews, with **Caffeine Intake** having a slightly stronger skew, the transformation of data is likely not needed. **Therapy Sessions** variable has a moderate right-skewed distribution, so it would potentially benefit from logarithmic transformation or box-cox.\n",
    "* The strength of linear relationship for most important numerical predictors was investigated using **Pearson's** and **Spearman's** coefficients.\n",
    "    * **Stress Level** has Pearson's coefficient $0.67$ (strong positive correlation with anxiety)\n",
    "    * **Sleep Hours** has Pearson's coefficient $-0.49$ (moderately negative correlation with anxiety)\n",
    "    * **Caffeine Intake** has Pearson's coefficient $0.35$ (moderately positive correlation with anxiety)\n",
    "    * **Therapy Sessions per Month** has Spearman's coefficient $0.33$ (moderately positive, Spearman used because of skew)\n",
    "* For binary categorical variables, both **t-test** and **Mann-Whitney U-test** showed extremely small p-values due to the large sample size ($11000$ rows). Hence, I computed **effect sizes** to inspect the significance in real-world data:\n",
    "    * **Family History of Anxiety** has small-to-moderate effect (**Cohen’s d** $  = 0.39$)\n",
    "    * **Smoking, Dizziness, Medication, Major Life Event**: have very small practical effects (**Cohen’s d** $< 0.2$)\n",
    "* For multi-category variables, ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis tests were applied, with **post-hoc Tukey’s HSD** and **Dunn’s tests** respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Normality** and **homoscedasticity** assumptions of **ANOVA** are violated, hence **Kruskal-Wallis** is preffered and reported.\n",
    "    * **Gender** shows no significant differences in anxiety levels\n",
    "    * **Occupation** shows significant differences between some of the occupations, but not for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, **Stress Levels**, **Sleep hours**, and **Family History of Anxiety** appear to be the main contributors to anxiety - individuals who experience more stress, sleep less and have a family history experience higher anxiety. Higher **daily caffeine intake** and larger number of **monthly therapy sessions** contributes to higher anxiety, with some occupations showing higher anxiety than others. Factors such as **smoking**, **experiecing dizziness**, **taking medication**, or **having a recent major life event** have only a minor impact on anxiety levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**:\n",
    "* Transform data - scaling, box-cox, logarithmic or other transformations of predictors.\n",
    "* Perform feature engineering, such as one-hot encoding for categorical variables.\n"
